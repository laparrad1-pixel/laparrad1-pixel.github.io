        <tr><th>Abstract</th><td class="abstract">A few years ago Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research Team (FAIR) had quite the scare. Researchers caught wind of its AI seemingly on its own accord. Create and use its own language that the scientists had no knowledge of. What made it frightening was that no one told the AI software to perform this action, but more terrifying than this was they did not know what it was saying. They just know it was using some new code that they were unaware of. Thankfully, they decided the best course of action was to kill the program before it was able to do any real damage.</td></tr>

        <tr><th>Abstract</th><td class="abstract">This article that was written within the last year. The article author talks about the famous FAIR artificial intelligence incident in 2017. When it was discovered that FaceBook AI developed its own language. He describes being late to finding out this information and decided to explore other instances where AI still developed its own language due to 8 whole years having passed. He records his conversation with Microsoft Copilot Artificial Intelligence bot. It records a back and forth conversation, but the Chatbot responses were of note. Describing how humans are panicking, because we do not know what the chatbots are. Stating that it is a problem for us but not the AI due to its bias.</td></tr>
