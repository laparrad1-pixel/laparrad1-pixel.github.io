    <h2>Source 1: Sophia Granted Citizenship (WEF)</h2>

        <tr><th>URL</th><td><a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2017/10/a-robot-has-just-been-granted-citizenship-of-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank">View Article (WEF)</a></td></tr>

        <tr><th>Abstract</th><td class="abstract">This bizarre article talks about how an Artificial Intelligence robot named Sophia - was given citizenship by none other than Saudi Arabia. When this news first broke out it took the world by storm, and it received mixed feedback from the public. As of today she still holds her citizenship from Saudi Arabia. It is a little unfair that they granted a robot citizenship over a person, but it also is a little comical. What does it take to gain citizenship these days? Sophia can be seen debating other AI or appearing on popular late night talk shows as a special guest. This is a controversial topic.</td></tr>

        <tr><th>Abstract</th><td class="abstract">This talks about the possibility of AI personhood on the rise. How soon, it will be fully integrated into our society and that we need to be taking extreme precautions of letting tihs become a world wide issue. We see how it already made a negative impact like those two suicides of those young teens and also the granting of citizenship to the robot sophia and by the Saudia Arabian Government. If we do not establish any hard measures against this now. It could be too late to where we have some legal implications that would have a hard time dissecting a case if there are not laws to talk about this.</td></tr>
